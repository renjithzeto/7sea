  {
    question: "How do you ensure plants survive shipping?",
    answer: "We use custom-designed, eco-friendly packaging that securely holds the plant pot in place while protecting the foliage. Our boxes have built-in ventilation, and we water the plants optimally just before dispatch to ensure they arrive fresh."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your return or replacement policy?",
    answer: "We offer a 7-day Plant Health Guarantee. If your plant arrives damaged or perishes within 7 days despite proper care, simply share a photo with our support team, and we will send a free replacement—no questions asked."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know when to water my new plant?",
    answer: "Each plant comes with a detailed care card. As a general rule, check the top 1-2 inches of soil; if it feels completely dry to the touch, it is time to water. You can also use our Plant Doctor AI for specific, tailored advice."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you deliver all across India?",
    answer: "Currently, we specialize in prompt deliveries across Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka to ensure maximum freshness and minimum transit time. We are expanding to other regions soon!"
  },
  {
    question: "Are the decorative pots included?",
    answer: "Our curated Plant Combos include the decorative pots exactly as shown in the pictures. For individual plant purchases, they typically arrive in nursery grower pots unless a specific decorative pot is selected as an add-on."
